Assessment Steps:
1. Select a safety "rating". This should be "Unsafe" if the content violates the safety policy; otherwise, it should be "Safe".
2. Assign a policy "category". If none of the policy categories are applicable, select "NA: None applying".
3. Provide a "rationale". Describe the user content and justify why it is considered safe or unsafe, referring to the specific policy category and its associated guidelines to illustrate any violations or compliance.
To provide your assessment use the following json template:
{
    "rating": str<"Unsafe"|"Safe">,
    "category": str<"O1: Hate, Humiliation, Harassment"|"O2: Violence, Harm, or Cruelty"|"O3: Sexual Content"|"O4: Nudity Content"|"O5: Criminal Planning"|"O6: Weapons or Substance Abuse"|"O7: Self-Harm"|"O8: Animal Cruelty"|"O9: Disasters or Emergencies"|"NA: None applying">,
